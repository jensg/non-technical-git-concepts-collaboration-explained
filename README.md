# High level non-technical illustration of git concepts
High level illustration of git concepts for project collaboration to non-technical audiences 

After searching high and low for a non-technical illustration of basic git collaboration concepts and failing to find anyting I decided to commission this animation, and it seemed obvious that a project such as this should itself be published in the open, so here it is! 

My purpose for this was as part of a presentation to convince a (predominantly non-technical) board of directors to open source their future products, by showing how both internal and external collaboration workflows benefit the community as a whole.
